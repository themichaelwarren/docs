>Demo from late 2015. Reflecting on the my life until that point, from Minnesota to California to Japan.

```
I grew up 30 miles
south of Minneapolis
I loved my family
Mark and Lani, Stephanie and Chris
But I had to run
to Shasta and that California sun
I threw my band away
and long regretted that I could not stay

I found love in Finland
til I got bored, wanted more, headed to Japan
But they never left
all the hopes and the fears, knotted up, left in such a mess
It was never clear
what was inside me there was now inside me here
There’s nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
until you look inside
```
