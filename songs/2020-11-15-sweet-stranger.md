```
I saw you walking home from the bookstore 
Where you wrote your poems about me
Well, that’s an assumption
That I function for you as you do for me
 
I wondered how you keep your desk 
On which corner does your sweet head rest? 
When you get tired of Whitman, and strange men
And estrangement from me

I’ve been sick for oh so long 
I have tried to be stronger 
But I’ll be sick til I hear you say
That every day you’ll be my lover 
Sweet stranger 

And you have a lover in Ontario
That is not something I was prepared to know
About you, but it’s the truth
I am chasing a sunbeam 
In a dream that is haunting me 
We are walking alone in the woods behind my street 
And it is pleasing and easy 
And the trees and fallen leaves and the gentle summer breeze
Are blushing, blushing, blushing, blushing
```
