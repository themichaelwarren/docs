>Written for a [School of Song](https://schoolofsong.org/){:target="_blank"} workshop with Scott McMicken, this song was pretty much entirely inspired by [the Vsauce video “Why Are We Morbidly Curious?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbdMMI6ty0o){:target="_blank"}

```
pick up the pen
sign the dotted line
it's no longer if but when

I start to pick up the knife
yeah, finally start to slice
start to look within

at endless sights untold
and stories to behold
that lie in wait just beneath the skin

what can I say
it makes me feel strong
even if I know it’s wrong
what can I say
I just can’t look away
I’ve got a morbid curiosity

pick up the pen
sign the dotted line
it's no longer if but when

I start to pick up the knife
yeah, finally start to slice
start to look within

at endless sights untold
and stories to behold
that lie in wait just beneath the skin

what can I say
it makes me feel strong
even if I know it’s wrong
I need that dopamine rush
I want that norepinephrine crush
what can I say
I just can’t look away
I’ve got a morbid curiosity

tell Carney Landis
I’ll play the kangling
tell Eugène Doyen
I want the real thing
that dopamine rush
norepinephrine crush
```
