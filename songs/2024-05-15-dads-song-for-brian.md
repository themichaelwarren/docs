```
June twenty
Forty two
Centinela
Hospital Medical Center

Your perfect pitch
Your eyes of blue
Me and Audree
Were so proud of you

--------------------

If I could find a way
To take back what I said
If you could find a way
A way to forgive your dad 

--------------------

You grew up fast
You made the scene
At school functions
Accordion lessons

You found your voice
You harmonized
The Four Freshmen
Your first obsession

You proved me wrong
You found real joy
So love and mercy
To you my boy
 
--------------------

If I could find a way
To take back what I said
If you could find a way
A way to forgive your dad
