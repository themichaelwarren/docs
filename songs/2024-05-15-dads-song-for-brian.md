```
June 20, 1942
Centinela Hospital Medical Center

Your perfect pitch, your eyes of blue
Me and Audree were so proud of you

--------------------

If I could find a way
To take back what I said
If you could find a way
A way to forgive your dad 

--------------------

You grew up fast, you made the scene
At school functions, accordion lessons

You found your voice, you harmonized
The Four Freshmen, your first obsession

You proved me wrong, you found real joy
So love and mercy to you my boy
 
--------------------

If I could find a way
To take back what I said
If you could find a way
A way to forgive your dad
