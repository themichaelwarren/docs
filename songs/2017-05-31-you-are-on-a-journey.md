>Cover of a beautiful song written by my songwriting partner Max Serota.

```
Go to the place you must go, don’t worry
Try not to hurry your time, why bother
Throw all your weaponry down, please settle down
Down to the valley you go to sleep there

You have come from far
And you’re going far
But the in-between is long
You are caviar
Bright as the northern star
But you feel like you are wrong

If you begin once again, with patience
Day after day you will grow, yes you will grow
If you could let down your guard, you will find trust
Taking the rust off yourself, you are new

You have come from far
And you’re going far
But the in-between is long
You are caviar
Bright as the northern star
But you feel like you are wrong

But you have strength and you are strong

If you’d only sing your song
We’d sing along
```
