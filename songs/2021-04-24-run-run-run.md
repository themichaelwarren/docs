```
You can't freak out in your living room

You are much too safe 
with your awkward crooked shelves 
and your pictures

How could you freak out 
with your blanket from Peru
Houdini on the wall

Near Washington Square
Body feels like gum
on the bottom of the stairs

So you run run run run run

Call the fancy car
Even though you're cheap
You sink into the seat

City gliding by
Buildings got too high
You feel like you are rich

And you run run run run run
run run run run run away

Run run run run run
Run run run run run
Run run run run run
```
