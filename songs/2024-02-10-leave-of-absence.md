```
The moon is new 
before it waxes
Got lots of cash 
before the taxes
And you can give your love
to anybody
First you become someone
then you become nobody

Decisions — none left to make
Positions — none left to stake
Maybe one more rule left to break
Before I take my leave of absence

The time’s been spent
The well’s run dry
Take the one seat
to say goodbye
to constructs and faith
Rise above it
Transform the pain
Moving right through it 

Decisions — none left to make
Positions — none left to stake
Maybe one more rule left to break
Before I take my leave of absence

```
